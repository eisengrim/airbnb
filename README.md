# Exploration of Airbnb listings in Montreal
## Exploration of Airbnb listings in Montreal

### Introduction
The primary goal of this project is to explore the changing presence of Airbnb listings in Montreal. Its conception was originally inspired by a [2018 report](https://mcgill.ca/newsroom/files/newsroom/channels/attach/airbnb-report.pdf) from the School of Urban Planning at McGill University which analysesd Airbnb activity in New York City and sought to answer the following four questions:

1. Where is Airbnb activity located in New York, and how is it changing?
2. Who makes money from Airbnb in New York?
3. How much housing has Airbnb removed from the market in New York?
4. Is Airbnb driving gentrification in New York?

Some pertinent findings of the report include the loss of up to 13500 housing units from NYC's long-term rental market and a 1.4% increase in the median rent since 2014. On top of this, Airbnb activity induced highly racialized gentrification: in predominantly Black neighbouhoods, Airbnb hosts were 5 times more likely to be white, earning an estimated $112 million more than their Black counterparts. Similar analyses looking at Airbnb's disruption to the local housing market have been done in [Athens](https://medium.com/athenslivegr/mapping-the-dominance-of-airbnb-in-athens-4cb9e0657e80) and [Barcelona](https://towardsdatascience.com/statistical-overview-of-barcelonas-airbnb-market-83dc7d6be648).

Despite the popularity of Airbnb, the convenience it offers travelers, and the boosts it grants to local tourism markets, it is not without controversy. Indeed, many municipalities often find themselves at odds with the house-sharing platform. Landlords have found that it is often more profitable to rent out a vacant apartment all year round, which results in shortages of available rental property and an increase in rent for local residents. [Other concerns](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-45083954) include harrassment, an exacerbation of segregation, a loss of community, and a permanent alteration of an area's cultural atmosphere due to the "over-tourism" that Airbnb facilitates. Cities like [Berlin](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/technology-36185271/berlin-cracks-down-on-airbnb-rentals) and [Tokyo](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44409187) have enacted measured to regulate Airbnb rentals, with other cities following suite. This includes rental caps and licenses. Other cities have [banned](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/23/world/europe/tourism-spain-airbnb-ban.html) short-term rentals entirely. Some regulations have already been enacted in Canadian cities such as [Vancouver](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/world/canada/vancouver-housing-airbnb.html?module=inline). In Toronto, a [new report](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/fairbnb-report-short-term-rentals-entire-homes-lost-1.4971332) published by the coalition Fairbnb claimed that 6500 homes could be added to Toronto's housing market if Airbnb were to comply to the city's new short-term rental rules. Both cities have banned residents from listing secondary properties.

In Montreal, the situation is just as stark. The Plateau and Ville-Marie (downtown), two boroughs with the highest number of available Airbnb listings, also have the lowest housing vacancy rate across the city. A [2017 study](https://globalnews.ca/news/4271771/montreal-borough-votes-to-restrict-airbnb-style-rentals-in-downtown-core/) by McGill University found that Airbnb has removed 14000 units from the city. Airbnb has disputed the results, pointing to the fact that 63 percent of listings were listed for fewer than 90 days. However, other problems arise. Illegal online apartment rentals are [so widespread](https://globalnews.ca/news/4826933/montreal-airbnb-illegal-apartments/) that the city is enlisting citizens, municipal workers, and the provincial revenue department to remove key safes left on public property (in 2015, the Quebec government passed a law requiring proper certification for people using a secondary residence for short-term rentals). 

Moreover, the question as to how Airbnb drives gentrification in Montreal is not presently well understood. The borough of Parc-Extension, a historical landing spot for immigrants to Canada, has seen a [steep increase](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/parc-extension-gentrification-universite-de-montreal-1.4650697) in rent and housing prices, largely due to development. My goal with this project is to understand the dynamics of Airbnb in this borough, as well as others in Montreal, in hopes of understanding how prevalence of Airbnb listings interacts with and drives gentrification in the city.
